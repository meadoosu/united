United

United is a personal web platform that brings together games, a soundboard, and a chat platform — all in one place.
Built by me, for fun, experimentation, and a little chaos.

The stack is simple and lightweight:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

a pinch of JSON

Nothing fancy, just stuff that works.

What’s Inside

A collection of browser-playable games, including Nintendo DS emulation.

Huge shoutout to these projects:

Used for DS emulation — genuinely awesome project, go support them.
